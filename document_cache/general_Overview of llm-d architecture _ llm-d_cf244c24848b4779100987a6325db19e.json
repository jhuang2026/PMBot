Leveraging operational telemetry, the Inference Scheduler implements the filtering and scoring algorithms to make decisions with P/D-, KV-cache-, SLA-, and loadawareness. Advanced teams can implement their own scorers to further customize, while benefiting from other features in IGW, like flow control and latency-aware balancing. See our Northstar design\n- · Disaggregated Serving with vLLM: llm-d  leverages vLLM's support for disaggregated serving to run prefill and decode on independent instances, using high-performance transport libraries like NVIDIA's NIXL. In llm-d , we plan to support latency-optimized implementation using fast interconnects (IB, RDMA, ICI) and throughput optimized implementation using data-center networking. See our Northstar design\n\n- · Disaggregated Prefix Caching with vLLM: llm-d  uses vLLM's KVConnector API to provide a pluggable cache for previous calculations, including offloading KVs to host, remote storage, and systems like LMCache. We plan to support two KV caching schemes. See our Northstar design\n- ◦ Independent t (north-south) caching with offloading to local memory and disk, providing a zero operational cost mechanism for offloading.\n- ◦ Shared d (east-west) caching with KV transfer between instances and shared storage with global indexing, providing potential for higher performance at the cost of a more operationally complex system.\n- · Variant Autoscaling over Hardware, Workload, and Traffic  (): We plan to implement a traffic- and hardware-aware autoscaler that (a) measures the capacity of each model server instance, (b) derive a load function that takes into account different request shapes and QoS, and (c) assesses recent traffic mix (QPS, QoS, and shapes) Using the recent traffic mix to calculate the optimal mix of instances to handle prefill, decode, and latency-tolerant requests, enabling use of HPA for SLO-level efficiency. See our Northstar design\n\nFor more, see the project proposal\n\n## Getting Started\n\nllm-d  can be installed as a full solution, customizing enabled features, or through its individual components for experimentation.\n\n## Deploying as a solution\n\nllm-d's deployer can be used to install it as a solution using a single Helm chart on Kubernetes.\n\nTip  See the guided experience with our quickstart .\n\n## Experimenting and developing with llm-d\n\nllm-d repo is a metaproject with subcomponents that can be cloned individually.\n\nTo clone all the components:\n\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d.git\n```\n\nTip  As a customization example, see here  a template for adding a scheduler scorer.\n\n## Releases\n\nVisit our GitHub Releases page  and review the release notes to stay updated with the latest releases.\n\n## Contribute\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- · See our project overview  for more details on our development process and governance.\n\n## Connect\n\n- · We use Slack to discuss development across organizations.
