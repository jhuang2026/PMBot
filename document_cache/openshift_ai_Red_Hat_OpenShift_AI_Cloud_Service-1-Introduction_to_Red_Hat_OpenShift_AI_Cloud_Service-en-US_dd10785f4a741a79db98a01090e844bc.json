OVERVIEW OF OPENSHIFT AI\nRed Hat OpenShift AI is a platform for data scientists and developers of artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning (AI/ML) applications.\nOpenShift AI provides an environment to develop, train, serve, test, and monitor AI/ML models and\napplications on-premise or in the cloud.\nFor data scientists, OpenShift AI includes Jupyter and a collection of default workbench images\noptimized with the tools and libraries required for model development, and the TensorFlow and PyTorch\nframeworks. Deploy and host your models, integrate models into external applications, and export\nmodels to host them in any hybrid cloud environment. You can enhance your data science projects on\nOpenShift AI by building portable machine learning (ML) workflows with data science pipelines, using\nDocker containers. You can also accelerate your data science experiments through the use of graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs) and Intel Gaudi AI accelerators.\nFor administrators, OpenShift AI enables data science workloads in an existing Red Hat OpenShift or\nROSA environment. Manage users with your existing OpenShift identity provider, and manage the\nresources available to workbenches to ensure data scientists have what they require to create, train, and\nhost models. Use accelerators to reduce costs and allow your data scientists to enhance the\nperformance of their end-to-end data science workflows using graphics processing units (GPUs) and\nIntel Gaudi AI accelerators.\nOpenShift AI has two deployment options:\nSelf-managed software\n that you can install on-premise or in the cloud. You can install\nOpenShift AI Self-Managed in a self-managed environment such as OpenShift Container\nPlatform, or in Red Hat-managed cloud environments such as Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated\n(with a Customer Cloud Subscription for AWS or GCP), Red Hat OpenShift Service on Amazon\nWeb Services (ROSA classic or ROSA HCP), or Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift.\nFor information about OpenShift AI as self-managed software on your OpenShift cluster in a\nconnected or a disconnected environment, see \nProduct Documentation for Red Hat OpenShift\nAI Self-Managed\n.\nA \nmanaged cloud service\n, installed as an add-on in Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (with a\nCustomer Cloud Subscription for AWS or GCP) or in Red Hat OpenShift Service on Amazon\nWeb Services (ROSA classic).\nFor information about OpenShift AI supported software platforms, components, and dependencies, see\nthe \nRed Hat OpenShift AI: Supported Configurations\n Knowledgebase article.\nFor a detailed view of the release lifecycle, including the full support phase window, see the \nRed Hat\nOpenShift AI Cloud Service Life Cycle\n Knowledgebase article.\nCHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW OF OPENSHIFT AI\n3\nCHAPTER 2. PRODUCT FEATURES\nRed Hat OpenShift AI provides several features for data scientists and OpenShift cluster\nadministrators.\n2.1. FEATURES FOR DATA SCIENTISTS\nContainers\nWhile tools such as JupyterLab already offer intuitive ways for data scientists to develop models on\ntheir machines, there are always inherent complexities involved with collaboration and sharing work.\nMoreover, using specialized hardware such as powerful GPUs can be very expensive when you have\nto buy and maintain your own. The Jupyter environment that is included with OpenShift AI lets you\ntake your development environment anywhere you need it to be. Because all of the workloads are\nrun as containers, collaboration is as easy as sharing an image with your team members, or even\nsimply adding it to the list of default containers that they can use. As a result, GPUs and large\namounts of memory are significantly more accessible, since you are no longer limited by what your\nlaptop can support.\nIntegration with third-party machine learning tools\nWe have all run into situations where our favorite tools or services do not play well with one another.\nOpenShift AI is designed with flexibility in mind. You can use a wide range of open source and third-\nparty tools with OpenShift AI. These tools support the complete machine learning lifecycle, from\ndata engineering and feature extraction to model deployment and management.\nCollaboration on Jupyter notebooks with Git\nUse Jupyter’s Git interface to work collaboratively with others, and track the changes to your code.\nSecurely built workbench images\nChoose from a default set of workbench images that are pre-configured with the tools and libraries\nthat you need for model development. Software stacks, especially those involved in machine learning,\ntend to be complex systems. There are many modules and libraries in the Python ecosystem that can\nbe used, so determining which versions of what libraries to use can be very challenging. OpenShift AI\nincludes many packaged workbench images that have been built with insight from data scientists and\nrecommendation engines. You can start new projects quickly on the right foot without worrying\nabout downloading unproven and possibly insecure images from random upstream repositories.\nCustom workbench images\nIn addition to workbench images provided and supported by Red Hat and independent software\nvendors (ISVs), you can configure custom workbench images that cater to your project’s specific\nrequirements.\nData science pipelines\nOpenShift AI with data science pipelines 2.0 provides an efficient way to run your data science\nworkloads. You can standardize and automate machine learning workflows that enable you to\ndevelop and deploy your data science models.\nModel serving\nAs a data scientist, you can deploy your trained machine-learning models to serve intelligent\napplications in production. Deploying or serving a model makes the model’s functions available as a\nservice endpoint that can be used for testing or integration into applications. You have much control\nover how this serving is performed.\nOptimize your data science models with accelerators\nIf you work with large data sets, you can optimize the performance of your data science models in\nOpenShift AI with NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) or Intel Gaudi AI accelerators.\nAccelerators enable you to scale your work, reduce latency, and increase productivity.\nRed Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service 1 Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service\n4\n2.2. FEATURES FOR OPENSHIFT CLUSTER ADMINISTRATORS\nManage users with an identity provider\nOpenShift AI uses the same authentication systems as your OpenShift cluster. By default, OpenShift\nAI is accessible to all users listed in your identity provider and those users do not need a separate set\nof credentials to access OpenShift AI. Optionally, you can limit the set of users who have access by\ncreating an OpenShift group that specifies a subset of users. You can also create an OpenShift\ngroup that identifies the list of users who have administrator access to OpenShift AI.\nManage resources with OpenShift\nUse your existing OpenShift knowledge to configure and manage resources for your OpenShift AI\nusers.\nControl Red Hat usage data collection\nChoose whether to allow Red Hat to collect data about OpenShift AI usage in your cluster. Usage\ndata collection is enabled by default when you install OpenShift AI on your OpenShift cluster.\nApply autoscaling to your cluster to reduce usage costs\nUse the cluster autoscaler to adjust the size of your cluster to meet its current needs and optimize\ncosts.\nManage resource usage by stopping idle workbenches\nReduce resource usage in your OpenShift AI deployment by automatically stopping workbenches\nthat have been idle for a period of time.\nImplement model-serving runtimes\nOpenShift AI provides support for model-serving runtimes. A model-serving runtime provides\nintegration with a specified model server and the model frameworks that it supports. By default,\nOpenShift AI includes the OpenVINO Model Server runtime. However, if this runtime does not meet\nyour needs (for example, if it does not support a particular model framework), you can add your own\ncustom runtimes.\nInstall in a disconnected environment\nOpenShift AI Self-Managed supports installation in a disconnected environment. Disconnected\nclusters are on a restricted network, typically behind a firewall and unable to reach the Internet. In this\ncase, clusters cannot access the remote registries where Red Hat provided OperatorHub sources\nreside. In this case, you deploy the OpenShift AI Operator to a disconnected environment by using a\nprivate registry in which you have mirrored (copied) the relevant images.\nManage accelerators\nEnable NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) or Intel Gaudi AI accelerators in OpenShift AI and\nallow your data scientists to use compute-heavy workloads.\nCHAPTER 2. PRODUCT FEATURES\n5\nCHAPTER 3. TRY IT\nData scientists and developers can try OpenShift AI and access tutorials and activities in the \nRed Hat\nDeveloper Sandbox\n environment.\nOpenShift cluster administrators can try OpenShift AI in your own cluster with a \n60-day product trial\n.\nRed Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service 1 Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift AI Cloud Service\n6\nCHAPTER 4.
