✅ **Good**: "Users cannot deploy RAG systems in air-gapped environments due to external dependencies, affecting 40% of enterprise customers"

### Solution-First Thinking
❌ **Bad**: Starting with "Implement feature X"
✅ **Good**: Starting with the user problem and working toward solutions

### Unmeasurable Success Criteria
❌ **Bad**: "System should be fast and reliable"
✅ **Good**: "Performance within 10% of connected deployments with 99.9% uptime"

### Missing Context
❌ **Bad**: Assuming readers understand the technical background
✅ **Good**: Providing sufficient context for stakeholders to understand the need

### Scope Creep
❌ **Bad**: Including everything related to the problem area
✅ **Good**: Clearly defining boundaries and future considerations

### Technical Without Business Value
❌ **Bad**: Focusing only on technical implementation details
✅ **Good**: Balancing technical requirements with clear business value

### External Dependencies Without Context
❌ **Bad**: Referencing external documents without explanation
✅ **Good**: Providing context and summarizing key points from external sources
